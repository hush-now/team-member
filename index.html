        <dd>We are a team of five senior students.They are Li Zhenchen, Song Yuheng, Yao Yaya,  Ma Yuanchao and Jiang Wenqing. We are both mechanical engineering students at Houston International College, Dalian Maritime University.
As graduating students,  we realize the importance of our graduation project for our future career development.  We are determined to apply our  knowledge and skills to practical projects in order to better prepare us for our future careers.
Our team has a diverse range of skills and expertise, including mechanical drawing,  CAD design and manufacturing processes.  We focus on teamwork,  mutual support and complementarity in order to be able to better complete our graduation project.
Our goal is to design and manufacture an innovative and practical mechanical device to solve a practical problem or  improve an existing process.  We will conduct detailed demand analysis and market research to ensure that our design can  meet the needs of users and the needs of the market.
The strength of our team lies in creativity,  teamwork and responsibility.  We believe that by pooling our ideas and supporting each other,  we will be able to overcome difficulties and achieve success.
We are eagerly looking forward to the challenge of this graduation project and believe that through the efforts and  talents of our team, we will set an excellent demonstration of the graduation project for the mechanical profession.
Thank you for your interest in our team,  we will continue to work hard to provide you with the best quality work results.
